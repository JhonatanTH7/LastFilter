Explanation of the proposed solution:

The team, led by the Scrum Master, proposes to address the problem with a RESTful API for coupon discount management. The solution includes adding accounts to the platform to ensure that the same user does not use the same coupon more than once. This API will facilitate efficient coupon management and prevent misuse, providing a more secure and reliable discount system.

Step-by-step guide to start up the application:

Identify the Problem: We start by clearly defining and exposing the problem that needs to be solved.

Determine Requirements: Next, we analyze and list the basic requirements of the application, ensuring we understand what the application needs to achieve.

Discuss Solutions: We then engage in discussions among team members to brainstorm and propose potential solutions.

Create UML Models: We begin with creating UML diagrams, including the Task Board and the Entity Relationship Model, to map out the project's structure and workflow.

Assign Tasks: Tasks are created and designated to each team member according to their roles and responsibilities.

Setup Environment: We prepare the development environment by creating the repository, setting up the project, and downloading the necessary dependencies.

Start Development: With everything in place, the development process begins. The Scrum Master oversees the progress and ensures the project advances smoothly by reviewing pull requests and addressing any issues that arise.

Continuous Integration: Regularly integrate code changes and review them to maintain a stable codebase and ensure the project is progressing without errors.

Overall, the Scrum Master coordinates the team's efforts, while the development team focuses on implementing the solution effectively and efficiently.
